# latexit

A home-made version of latexit. 
Heavily inspired by the original LaTeXiT (see https://www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/). 

Really does a minimal job.
Produces svg output and automatically copies to clipboard to be pasted to a message window in Thunderbird.
Otherwise, the svg is there, ready to use in e.g. LibreOffice Impress.

Updated on Aug 12, 2021 to produce an eps output, as well.
